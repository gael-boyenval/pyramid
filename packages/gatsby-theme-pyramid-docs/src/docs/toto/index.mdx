## Variations

### Color themes

We created different color themes to suit what you need in your design.
You can use `primary` (default), `neutral` and `danger` theme in `solid` and `bordered` declination. These declinations can help you to make what's important stand out.

| Color theme | Usage                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary     | For main actions on the page or engaging actions                                        |
| Primary-02  | For main specific actions dedicated to Campus                                           |
| Neutral     | For secondary or minor actions on the page                                              |
| Danger      | For buttons who the following actions is irrevocable, like deleting a product in a cart |

### Sizes

There is 3 sizes for the buttons to create hierarchy and for a better adaptability.

| Size                   | Value        |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| **Small**              | 2mu (32px)   |
| **Medium** (_default_) | 3mu (48px)   |
| **Large**              | 3.5mu (56px) |

### Displaying buttons with icons

In the button component, you can also add icons:

- On the left
- On the right
- Icon only

Icons are availables in different sizes depending on the button size. Here you can find which icon you can use for each button size:

| **Button size** | **Icon only**                      | **Icon + text** |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Small**       | 1.5mu (24px)                       | 1.5mu (24px)    |
| **Medium**      | 2mu (32px)                         | 1.5mu (24px)    |
| **Large**       | 2.5mu (48px) [_displayed in 40px_] | 2mu (32px)      |

### Width behaviour

A button width can either fit its content or its container.
